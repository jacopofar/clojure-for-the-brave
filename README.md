# Clojure For The Brave And True

This repository contains the code and the examples written following the book __Clojure For The Brave And True__, I use it as a notebook and to share what I've seen.

Since I know Javascript, and for some aspects is similar to Clojure, when possible I draw a comparison between the two languages. For additional information about Javascript / LISPs comparison see [this article](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/07/18/javascript-isnt-scheme/)

I'm definitely not a Clojure expert (that's why I'm reading this book in first place), so feel free to open issues or pull requests as you may feel fit.
