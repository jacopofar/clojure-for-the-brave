# Clojure For The Brave And True

This repository contains the code and the examples written following the book __Clojure For The Brave And True__, I use it as a notebook and to share what I've seen.

Since I think Javascript is the language I knw most similar to Clojure, when possible I draw a comparison between the two languages.

I'm definitely not a Clojure expert (that's why I'm reading this book in first place), so feel free to open issues or pull requests as you may feel fit.
